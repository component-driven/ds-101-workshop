# Backing a toast

## Ice breaker

<Notes>

### Why

We are doing this exercise as an ice-breaker. This helps our participants to get to know each other and us. During this exercise, we are also trying-out the collaborative tools which we are going to use further in the workshop.

### How

This describes how an exercise happens offline.

1. Each participant gets 5 postage notes.
1. The task is:<br/> Please draw the stages of making a toast in the morning. You can go wild, we had some people who started with buying a farm because they needed to produce bread. But finally you should have a nice crispy toast, and you have 5 postages to illustrate the steps. It is nice to have drawings not words because it's just funny. But of course you can do what you want, including writing in any language. 3 minutes for this ex. Countdown starts now!
1. People are united in groups of 4 (semi-randomly)
1. The following task:<br/> Now you are a group. Review each other's steps and collect them all into a sequence. If it happens that two or three of you have exactly the same steps, you can merge them. If these steps are even slightly different, keep them separate and give them right order. Put your sequence onto a whiteboard.
1. Final task:<br/> Each group presents what they have.

### Conculusion

We had a lot of fun!
