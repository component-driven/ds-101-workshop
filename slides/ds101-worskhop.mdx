# Backing a toast

## Ice breaker

<Notes>

### Why

We are doing this exercise as an ice-breaker. This helps our participants to get to know each other and us. During this exercise, we are also trying-out the collaborative tools which we are going to use further in the workshop.

### How

This describes how an exercise happens offline.

1. Each participant gets 5 postage notes.
1. The task is:<br/> Please draw the stages of making a toast in the morning. You can go wild, we had some people who started with buying a farm because they needed to produce bread. But finally you should have a nice crispy toast, and you have 5 postages to illustrate the steps. It is nice to have drawings not words because it's just funny. But of course you can do what you want, including writing in any language. 3 minutes for this ex. Countdown starts now!
1. People are united in groups of 4 (semi-randomly)
1. The following task:<br/> Now you are a group. Review each other's steps and collect them all into a sequence. If it happens that two or three of you have exactly the same steps, you can merge them. If these steps are even slightly different, keep them separate and give them right order. Put your sequence onto a whiteboard.
1. Final task:<br/> Each group presents what they have.

### Conculusion

We had a lot of fun!

# Naming things

<Notes>

### Why

We are doing this exercise to demonstrate that working in isolation people may name
the same things differently, as a result, this makes future communication more complex,
decreases maintainability and increases production costs.

### How

There are mockups of small pieces of some interface. Each piece has two copies. In the
following exercise, we distribute the mockups to the two copies of the same mockup get to
a designer and a developer. For easier matching, the mockups are color-coded.

Participants are divided into two groups: designers and developers. Designers and developers
go to two different rooms where they get their tasks. Each participant gets a mockup of
some interface. Mockups do not have any additional information, just a sketch of some UI.
Participants get the following 5-minute tasks:

**For designers**

You are getting mocks with some interface. Please write instructions for a designer who creates a visual design. Describe what exactly a designer has to draw. You should somehow name the patterns or components they are going to design, and use these names in your description. Maybe you will also need to name some subparts of the interface. Write in English or any other language. 3-4 sentences if enough.

**For developers**

You are getting mocks with some interface. Please write instructions for a developer who is going to code this into a component. Describe what functionality this component has and how a user interacts with it. You should somehow name the pieces of the interface and use these names in your description. Maybe you also need to name some subparts of the components. Write in English or any other language. 3-4 sentences if enough.

In 5 minutes, all are getting back to the common room. We match copies of the same mockup
so that we a description for a designer and a developer. We make a "presentation" of
every joined description so that it gets clear how the same things can get different names
when people are working in isolation.

### Conculusion

Shared vocabulary is very important, it results in more productive cooperative work.
