# Making a Toast

</Primary>

<Notes>

## Key words

Before focusing on design system, we do team exercise as an ice breaker.

## Why

We are doing this exercise as an ice-breaker. This helps our participants to get to know each other and us. During this exercise, we are also trying-out the collaborative tools which we are going to use further in the workshop.

## How

This describes how an exercise happens offline.

1. Each participant gets 5 postage notes.
1. The task is:<br/> Please draw the stages of making a toast in the morning. You can go wild, we had some people who started with buying a farm because they needed to produce bread. But finally you should have a nice crispy toast, and you have 5 post-its to illustrate the steps. It is nice to have drawings not words because it ºs just funny. But of course you can do what you want, including writing in any language. 3 minutes for this ex. Countdown starts now!
1. People are united in groups of 4 (semi-randomly)
1. The following task:<br/> Now you are a group. Review each other ºs steps and collect them all into a sequence. If it happens that two or three of you have exactly the same steps, you can merge them. If these steps are even slightly different, keep them separate and give them right order. Put your sequence onto a whiteboard.
1. Final task:<br/> Each group presents what they have.

## Conclusion

We had a lot of fun!

<Notes>

### Why

We are doing this exercise to demonstrate that working in isolation people may name the same things differently, as a result, this makes future communication more complex, decreases maintainability and increases production costs.

### How

There are mockups of small pieces of some interface. Each piece has two copies. In the following exercise, we distribute the mockups to the two copies of the same mockup get to a designer and a developer. For easier matching, the mockups are color-coded.

Participants are divided into two groups: designers and developers. Designers and developers go to two different rooms where they get their tasks. Each participant gets a mockup of some interface. Mockups do not have any additional information, just a sketch of some UI. Participants get the following 5-minute tasks:

**For designers**

You are getting mocks with some interface. Please write instructions for a designer who creates a visual design. Describe what exactly a designer has to draw. You should somehow name the patterns or components they are going to design, and use these names in your description. Maybe you will also need to name some subparts of the interface. Write in English or any other language. 3-4 sentences if enough.

**For developers**

You are getting mocks with some interface. Please write instructions for a developer who is going to code this into a component. Describe what functionality this component has and how a user interacts with it. You should somehow name the pieces of the interface and use these names in your description. Maybe you also need to name some subparts of the components. Write in English or any other language. 3-4 sentences if enough.

In 5 minutes, all are getting back to the common room. We match copies of the same mockup so that we a description for a designer and a developer. We make a "presentation" of every joined description so that it gets clear how the same things can get different names when people are working in isolation.

### Conclusion

Shared vocabulary is very important, it results in more productive cooperative work.

# Parts of design system

</Primary>

<Notes>

## Key words

Content of design system (components, patterns, etc) need proper representation.
How do we show and document them?

## Why

We are doing this exercise to demonstrate several meanings:

1. A design system cannot contain everything
1. Design system should be focused on the things relevant to specific project/organization
1. Defining parts of design system requires separate workshop/meeting/etc

## How

We are doing Nathan Curtis º exercise for the teams who are starting a design system https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/picking-parts-products-people-a06721e81742

Our exercise is in a digital format. Participants get a link to Google Sheet with the
exercise. They have "view" rights for this sheet. Everyone can copy the sheet to their
own Google Drive. This way, everyone gets their editable copy.

The exercise is done in three steps.

First, participants cross out 5 the most irrelevant categories (boxes).
Seconds, out of the left categories, participants select 5 the most relevant categories (boxes).
Third, inside the selected categories, participants tick 25 items using the checkboxes.

Once done, all the participants present their choices and explain them.

Link to the workshop sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WO92vycLlDkDXr9rb1sztzXmlcUn1qeUTEkfvpOOuWk/edit?usp=sharing

## Conslusion

The design systems are very different and it usually does not make much sense just to copy
someone else ºs. The content of your design system should respond to the needs of your organization
or project. Deciding what should be in your design system is a separate kind of activity.
It is worth to run a little in-house workshop similar to this exercise which would help
to find out the relevant parts of your design system.

# Pattern Journey

</Primary>

<Notes>

## Key words

Design systems are organization (or project-) specific. The processes
of maintaining them are also different from company to company. Now
we will invent the process which is best for our situation.

## Why

We are doing this exercise to outline the process of maintaining a design system. As a result,
we get to know what is happening, who are the actors on the way and what tools they are
using.

We share stories about how this exercise was run on real projects and how to interpret its
outcomes.

## How

Note! When running the exercise with a group of unfamiliar people, it is easy to go with
a specific pattern. Say, login form. But when repeating this exercise again with their
project teams, people can outline the whole process.

Participants go to the whiteboard with prepared canvas. The exercise activities:

1. Introducing canvas
1. Naming the 5 stages (15 minutes)
1. "What" lane (45 minutes)
1. "Who" lane (15 minutes)
1. "How" lane (15 minutes)

# Conclusion

Every time when we run this exercise, we get very different results. But interpretation of
these results was always fruitful. In this case, we analyse the outcome we get now and
share information about pattern journeys at our projects.
